Network Topology
================

Topology will be described by a set of models that will have graph analogs so that we can
represent the network elements and links as directed graphs. The terminology below was
lifted from the ONOS Model Objects.

* Device - A network infrastructure element, e.g. a , switch, router, access-point, or 
           middle-box (including servers or VM Instances). Devices have a set of
           interfaces/ports and a DeviceId. Devices are interior vertices of the network graph.
           
* Port - A network interface on a Device. A Port and DeviceId pair forms a ConnectPoint,
         which represents an endpoint of a graph edge. 

* Host - A network end-station, which has an IP address, MAC address, VLAN ID, and a
         ConnectPoint. Hosts are exterior (leaf) vertices of the network graph.

* Link - A directed link between two infrastructure Devices (ConnectPoints). Links are
         interior edges of the network graph.

* EdgeLink - A specialized Link connecting a Host to a Device. EdgeLinks are exterior
             edges of the network graph.

* Path - A list of one or more adjacent Links, including EdgeLinks. EdgeLinks, if
         present in the path, can only be exterior links (beginning and end of the list).

* Topology - A Snapshot of a traversable graph representing the network.
